# Data Driven Culture
![img-center-95](images/ddc_compass.png)

???
+ Facilitators briefly introduce the idea that data analysis is a team sport
+ Facilitators connect this idea to the collaborative introduction exercise that follows

---

# A Few Ground Rules
--

+ Step up, step back
--

+ Be curious and ask questions!
--

+ Assume noble regard and positive intent
--

+ Respect multiple perspectives 
--

+ Listen deeply
--

+ Be present (phone, email, social media, etc.)

---

# Introduce Yourself to Your Neighbor
+ Who are you?
+ Where do you work?
+ What has been the proudest moment in your job?

???
+ Participants engage in a collaborative introduction exercise to engage their fellow participants and begin the day talking
+ Participants relax into the container created by the facilitators

# Let's talk data.

???
+ Facilitator asks participants what types of data they work with


---


# The Value of Data
--

+ Data tells a story about something that's happened
--

+ Can describe what happened directly or indirectly
--


![img-center-90](images/311data_rev.png)


???
+ Facilitators prompt students with the question "Why is data useful?" and/or "Why do we use it?"
+ Facilitators contrast this with the question "How would we make decisions without data?" to tease out the need for data to check assumptions and limited problem awareness
+ Facilitators carefully acknowledge that intuition, experience, and anecdotes can be useful but shouldn't be the sole source of knowledge and information
+ Reference: [Sensing Noise in NYC](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/07/nyregion/to-create-a-quieter-city-theyre-recording-the-sounds-of-new-york.html?_r=0)

# Are All Data Points Created Equal?
???
+ Facilitators lead a brief discussion of the issues with data
+ Issues to be touched on include: data entry errors, biases in data, data cleaning errors, etc.
---

class:middle
> Facts do not "speak for themselves." They speak for or against competing theories. Facts divorced from theory or visions are mere isolated curiosities.

##-Thomas Sowell *A Conflict of Visions*

???
+ Facilitators develop the theme of data skepticism by talking about the importance of context to understanding numbers provided in analysis
+ An example I often use is "What if I told you there's a 2% drop in crime? What do we need to know to make that number useful?"
+ Facilitator emphasizes that the goal of analysis is telling a true and compelling story, and communicating context whenever possible

 (happiness, health, well-being, etc.)

# 5 Data Analytics Tasks
--

1. Sorting
--

2. Filtering
--

3. Aggregating (PivotTable)
--

4. Manipulating
--

5. Visualizing

---

# 1. Sorting
--

+ Reorganize rows in a dataset based on the values in a column
--

+ Can sort on multiple columns

---

# Sorting by Date

---

# Sorting by Date
![img-center-60](images/sort4.png)

![img-center-60](images/sort_final.png)

---

# 2. Filtering
--

+ Only show rows that contain some value
--

+ Can filter by multiple values
--

+ Can filter by values in multiple columns

---

# Filtering by Agency Name
![img-center-100](images/filtering1.png)

---

# Filtering by Agency Name
![img-center-40](images/filtering2.png)

---

# 3. Aggregating Data 
--

+ Trends only become clear in aggregate
--

+ Often where you discover the "so what"
--

+ Aggregating data meaningfully can be tricky

---
# PivotTables
--

+ A data summarization tool
--

+ Useful to quickly understand data
--

+ Can use to graph data totals
--



![img-center-100](images/pt1.png)

---

# Creating a PivotTable
![img-center-60](images/pt2.png)
--

+ Should default to all your data .red[unless you have any cells selected]
--

+ Should default to a new worksheet

---

# Creating a PivotTable
![img-right-40](images/pt3.png)
## Drag and drop fields to visualize
+ Row labels 
+ Values
+ Filter
+ Column Labels

---

# Creating a PivotTable
![img-center-100](images/pt4.png)

---

# 4. Manipulating Data (In a good way...)
--

+ Sometimes available categories don't make sense
--

+ Values may not be in the format you need (or have mistakes)
--

+ You always want to have a clean copy of the data to go back to
--

+ Best to keep track of what you've done
