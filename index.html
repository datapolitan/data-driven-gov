# Types of Analysis

---

# 1. Quantifying Needs
--

+ How much of X do I need?
--

+ What goes into producing X (time, money, resources, people, etc.)?
--

+ How much does my need change given a different set of conditions?
--

+ How does X play into my organization’s mission and goals?
--

+ What’s the most meaningful way of quantifying X?

# 6 Analytical Steps
![img-center-90](images/sixphases_1.jpg)

---

# 1. Problem Formulation
--

+ What question or need am I trying to answer?
--

+ What’s my organization’s mission and goals?
--

+ How can I best apply data to this task?

---

# 2. Data Gathering/Preliminary Analysis
--

+ What data do I think I’m going to need?
--

+ What condition is it in?
--

+ Does it tell me what I need?
--

+ What other data might I need?
--

+ How much work do I need to put into the data?

---

# 3. Data Cleaning
--

+ Make the data usable and compatible
--

+ Takes up the most amount of time
--

+ May require more sophisticated tools depending on the state and size of the data

---

# 4. Hypothesis Testing
--

+ Am I getting the results I’d hoped for?
--

+ What other questions come up?
---

# 5. Verification
--

+ Do my results make sense?
--

+ Did I make a simple mistake?
--

+ Check twice and you’ll sleep easier

+ “A picture is worth a thousand words”
--

+ Communicate results clearly and concisely
--

+ Help to better understand your data
--

+ The eyes have a much higher bandwidth into the brain

# Exploratory Data Analysis
--

+ Goal -> Discover patterns in the data
--

+ Understand the context
--

+ Summarize fields
--

+ Use graphical representations of the data
--

+ Explore outliers

--

####Tukey, J.W. (1977). Exploratory data analysis. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley

# Question-Driven Analysis
--

+ Goal -> Answer a specific problem or concern
--

+ Have a question or problem in mind when analyzing data
--

+ “I need to know X”
--

+ Problem-focused discovery with the data
---

# Exercise - Vision Zero (dB)
--

+ Given 311 noise complaint data, assist enforcement efforts by identifying community districts that have a high volume of noise complaints and the time frame enforcement resources should be deployed to combat the noise issue at its peak
--

+ Identify the prevalent types of noise complaints in these areas to guide enforcement in each community district
